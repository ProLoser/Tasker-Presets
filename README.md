# Tasker-Presets
This is a place to share and collaborate on individual Profiles, Tasks and Scenes for Android Tasker.

Hopefully over time these presets can evolve to become more powerful, more customizeable, and easier to setup.

### Requests
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ProLoser/Tasker-Presets/issues) if you have requests or would like assistance setting up your copy of Tasker.

### Setup
1. Download the desired xml files to your phone.
2. In Tasker, go to the tab for the type of item to import (Profile, Task, Scene)
3. Click on the active tab _again_ to bring up a context menu
4. Select 'Import'
5. Navigate to the XML file on your local phone
6. Follow Setup instructions for the preset.

### Contributing
I am open to requests. However if you'd like to contribute, submit a PR with your own presets. Do not submit your entire backup.
